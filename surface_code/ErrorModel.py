# R error is a one-qubit Pauli immediately after
# CNOT error is a two-qubit Pauli immediately after
# MR error can either be
#   - a one-qubit Pauli immediately after (in the case where the qubit decohered before readout), or
#   - a one-qubit Pauli that appears both before and after (in the case where readout was wrong)
