# Pauli_channel_simulator
Fast simulation of quantum error-correcting codes at large code distances under Pauli noise channels.
Operates atop your favorite Clifford simulator, which is used to simulate the parity check circuits of the code at a small (fixed) code distance.
Currently written for rotated surface code with the most basic form of parity check circuits.
